# Derived Resource Marker


This is an Eclipse plugin that can help to mark resources in a workspace as derived. 

**Derived resources are excluded in searches.**

You can use this plugin in two ways:

1. You can let the plugin determine which resources to mark as derived based on the preferences. 
1. You can select a resource (eg. workingset or project) and let the plugin mark all children of that resource as derived.

The plugin can use the pom packaging of a maven module to determine if the resources should be marked as derived.

## Installation
The plugin can be installed in Eclipse by using the update site.
